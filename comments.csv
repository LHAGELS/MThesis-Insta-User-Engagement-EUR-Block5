1,2,"Breakfast of champions 💪🏼 Oats topped with blueberries, caramelized banana, hemp hearts, pepitas, Greek yogurt, and peanut butter 😍 This was such a delicious meal to refuel after a @rebeccakennedynyc strength workout! Honestly her playlist was so fire that I couldn’t even pay attention to the workout half the time 🤷🏼‍♀️ Anyone else sing and dance during your workouts?"

7,2,"You guys will LOVE this vegan creamy sun dried tomato pasta recipe! Made with nourishing, nutrient-dense ingredients including @zenb_life Pasta, this dish is packed with plant-based protein, fiber and healthy fats.  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀The creamy sun dried tomato sauce is super easy to whip up in your blender. I used @zenb_life Penne Pasta, which is made from 100% yellow peas. @zenb_life uses the entire yellow pea (including the skin) to make their pasta, which makes it high in fiber and a good source of protein. It's an excellent alternative for your pasta recipes because it has the same taste and al dente texture as traditional pasta.  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀You can find this vegan, gluten free recipe on my blog now.

9,2,"Pop quiz for national gluten free day: Do you know what gluten is? #yesapplespartner  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀A: Gluten is the protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It provides structure to these grains, but some people are intolerant to, or have an autoimmune response to gluten (Celiac disease). Whether or not you follow a gluten free diet, so many delicious foods are naturally gluten free! The fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, dairy, and protein that make up our meals all do not contain gluten. There are also plenty of gluten free grains, including quinoa, rice, gluten free oats, and buckwheat.  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Since it's gluten free day,  I've got my favorite gluten free grain in my breakfast bowl. Coconut quinoa breakfast porridge with fresh fruit and nuts is the vibe this morning! 🤤 Cooked in coconut milk, cinnamon, ginger, and a little maple syrup, it's the perfect vehicle for nuts, seeds, fresh fruit and @koruappleusa. 🍎 They're one of my favorite apples because they're crunchy, sweet, and slow to brown (perfect for food photography, hehe). What's your favorite gluten free meal? @yesapples"
